		We know there are a lot of search engines out there like Google, Yahoo!, Bing, etc. so the natural
	question arises, "What is new in your system?". The answer to this is rather very simple. The problem with
	the above mentioned search engines and the likes is that they just provide links to content. This giver too
	many results to pursue to the users, who can and often become very confused. The hunger to get some quick
	and concise answers remains un-satisfied. This is where our present system comes in. It generates summaries
	for users that are concise, meaningful and the best thing, they point the user in the right direction.
