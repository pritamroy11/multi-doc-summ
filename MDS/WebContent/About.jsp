		The present work is the result of continuous work done for over 10 months by Suman Saha, Pritam Roy, Saurav Das,
	and Sourav Ghosh of Government College of Engineering and Ceramic Technology, Kolkata under their
	project guide Mr. Bijoy Kumar Mandal for their final year B. Tech project.

		We know there are a lot of search engines out there like Google, Yahoo!, Bing, etc. so the natural
	question arises, "What is new in your system?". The answer to this is rather very simple. The problem with
	the above mentioned search engines and the likes is that they just provide links to content. This gives too
	many results to pursue to the users, who may and often become very confused. The hunger to get some quick
	and concise answers remains un-satisfied. This is where our present system comes in. It generates summaries
	for users that are concise, meaningful and the best thing, they point the user in the right direction.
